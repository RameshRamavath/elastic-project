# HBase Data model

**Flexible schema - no need to mention or give column names while creating HBase table**

*In application developer can maintain logic for adding columns to specific table on the fly*


#### Namespace

 - A namespace is a **logical grouping of tables** analogous to a **database** in relation database systems
 - **Use**:
   - **Quota Management** - Restrict the amount of resources (i.e. regions, tables) a namespace can consume.
   - **Namespace Security Administration** - Provide another level of security administration for tenants.
   - **Region server groups** - A namespace/table can be pinned onto a subset of RegionServers thus guaranteeing a coarse level of isolation
 
 
     #Create a namespace
     create_namespace 'my_ns'
 
**In HBase, data is stored in tables, which have rows and columns, but it's better to visualize it as a **multi-dimensional map****
  
#### Table

  *An HBase table consists of multiple rows*
  
  **ROW** in HBase consists of a row key and one or more columns with values associated with them and rows re sorted by the row key - hence **the design of the row key is very important**

  **Column** in HBase consists of a column family and a column qualifier, which are delimited by a : (colon) character.  
  
  **Column Family**
  
     Column families physically colocate a set of columns and their values, often for performance reasons. Each column family has a set of storage properties, such as whether its values should be cached in memory, how its data is compressed or its row keys are encoded, and others
  
  **Column Qualifier**
  
     A column qualifier is added to a column family to provide the index for a given piece of data. 
     Given a column family content, a column qualifier might be content:html, and another might be content:pdf. 
     Though column families are fixed at table creation, column qualifiers are mutable and may differ greatly between rows.
  
  **Cell**
  
     A cell is a combination of row, column family, and column qualifier, and contains a value and a timestamp, which represents the valueâ€™s version.
  
  Tables are declared up front at schema definition time
  
     Row -> Key {Column Family {group of columns}}
     
     Row           : Rows are lexicographically sorted with the lowest order appearing first in a table
     Column Family : Columns in Apache HBase are grouped into column families. All column members of a column family have the same prefix
                     courses:history and 
                     courses:math
                     
                     courses - one column family
                     history & math - Columns
                     
     column qualifier: A new column qualifier (column_family:column_qualifier) can be added to an existing column family at any time.
     Cell          : A {row, column, version} tuple exactly specifies a cell in HBase        
  
#### Conceptual View

  In HBase for each PUT operation one timestamp will be maintained along with the columns we have added.

  in this view it looks very sparse, but in data store [physically] it won't store any NULL values
  
#### Physical view

  Physically the data is stored by column family. A new column qualifier (column_family:column_qualifier) can be added to an existing column family at any time.
